## Introduction
I'm currently student in `KAIST`

Interested in System Programming, Operating System, Program Developing.


## Main Developing Language
Mainly using Python for quick developing
~~~
lang = Python
print(f"Because {lang} can do anything!")
~~~
Using C for sub-language
~~~
char* lang = "C";
printf("Because %s is fast", lang);
~~~
Other language I can treat is..
~~~
String lang = new String("Java");
System.out.println(lang + " a little bit");
~~~
~~~
val lang = "Scala"
def print(lang: Array[String]) {
    println(lang + " a little bit too")
}
print(lang)
